# Project Instructions

## Deployment Learning Journey

This project includes a deployment learning journal at `DEPLOYMENT-LEARNING.md`.

**Important:** When the user says "remember" during deployment learning sessions, update the journal with:
- Progress checkmarks on completed steps
- Notes and learnings discovered
- Commands used
- Issues encountered and solutions

This helps track learning across sessions.
